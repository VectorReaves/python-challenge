Here I will explain the results of the analysis.

In this project, we are looking at content from a CSV file which contains financial infomormation on company. 

we use the "import" to use those externtal libraries. Such as import csv.

Then we need to set up our varibles to use throughout the rest of the program like 'totalmonths', 'greatestdecrease' ect. that focus on the specific thing wwe are looking for.

Below provides the path to the csv file. I nmy case, due to an error with the terminal location and the file location (which I contacted Emerson support for) I am forced to manuelly insert the entire address startign at Destktop.
csvpath = os.path.join('Desktop', 'GitHub', 'python-challenge', 'PyBank', 'Resources', 'budget_data.csv')

Then we need to create a new variable using the reader command. 'csvfile' variable with the delimiter. We also need to read the header row and keep an eye on any changes.
    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
    
    csvHeader = next(csvreader)
    row = next(csvreader)
    
    previousRow = int(row[1])
    totalMonths += 1
    netAMount += int(row[1])
    greatestIncrease = int(row[1])
    greatestIncreaseMonth = row[0]
    
    
 We then need a for loop to pass through every row 
 for row in csvreader:
        
        totalMonths += 1
        netAMount += int(row[1])

        revenue_change = int(row[1]) - previousRow
        monthlyChange.append(revenue_change)
        previousRow = int(row[1])
        monthlyCount.append(row[0])
        
        if int(row[1]) > greatestIncrease:
            greatestIncrease = int(row[1])
            greatestIncreaseMonth = row[0]
            
        if int(row[1]) < greatestDecrease:
            greatestDecrease = int(row[1])
            greatestDecreaseMonth = row[0]  
        
  Then, just like in Saturdays class, we need to find the sum of the monthly change and the length using len command.
    averageChange = sum(monthlyChange)/ len(monthlyChange)
    
    highest = max(monthlyChange)
    lowest = min(monthlyChange)
    
    Finally at the end you would print out the results with f strings.
